Data Descriptions

Data files result_R.mat, etc, are created from Matlab and have
processed time series of wave height, water depth, peak frequency vs yearday.

These have been corrected for atmospheric pressure as well as could be done using
non-proprietary data. These atmospheric corrections will likely change slightly
in the future but this should not affect any mean water levels by more than 10cm.

Gauge R has some bad parts late in the record well after Ike.

Gauge locations are in the file 'Ike_Gauges_web.txt'. 

Largest surge: Z and Y is also large. These are well offshore and
surges at the shoreline will be larger. These are not in NAVD 88 but are in local apparent MSL. I have some NAVD88 corrections
if needed. 

The noise floor is around Hs=10-15cm. Around here, the heights are not really believable.

The program 'plot_data.m' gives a basis for plotting and looking at the data.
